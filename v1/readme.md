## Overview  
This project involves an autonomous drone system that navigates through predefined waypoints, capturing images of crowded areas. The images are processed in real-time to estimate crowd density, and the analyzed data (including crowd count and location coordinates from the drone's GPS) is structured and transmitted back to the ground station. The ground station compiles this information to generate actionable insights, such as identifying high-density zones and suggesting optimal rescue operation plans for emergency response teams. The system aims to enhance situational awareness during large gatherings or disaster scenarios, enabling faster and more efficient decision-making.
