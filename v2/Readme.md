# Version 2

## Drawbacks of version 1
1. Image processing from a moving quad leads to too many complications in capture and analysis.
2. A single quad fails to actively scan a large area and takes time to produce results.
3. The technique of "Image Processing" is prone to highly inaccurate results, and in disaster situations, these inaccuracies increase further.

## Upgrades & Improvements
1. We fix the quad to a particular co-ordinate scanning a particular region.
2. Multi Node system planned to be integrated.
3. Possible shift from Image Processing to Thermal Imaging
