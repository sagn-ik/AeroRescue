# Version 2

## Drawbacks of version 1
1. Image processing from a moving quad leads to too many complications in capture and analysis.
2. A single quad fails to actively scan a large area and takes time to produce results.
3. The technique of "Image Processing" is prone to highly inaccurate results, and in disaster situations, these inaccuracies increase further.

## Upgrades & Improvements
1. We fix the quad to a particular co-ordinate scanning a particular region.
2. Multi Node system planned to be integrated.
3. Possible shift from Image Processing to Thermal Imaging

### What is a multi node system here?
Scan a designated region (e.g., 1000 sq ft) using a network of drones for efficient coverage and data analysis.

Coverage Capacity:
Each drone can scan an area of 100 sq ft.
For a 1000 sq ft region, deploy 10 drones to ensure full coverage.

Deployment Strategy:
Divide the region into a grid/matrix structure.
Position each drone at optimal nodes within the grid for uniform scanning.

Data Processing:
Each drone collects and transmits scan data to a central ground station.
The ground station compiles and analyzes the aggregated data.

Visualization:
Results are displayed on a map using color grading (or similar visual indicators) to represent different data intensities (e.g., temperature, contamination, structural integrity).
